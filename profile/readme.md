<h1>'Rosario' (2𝟶𝟸𝟻) 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝗈𝚗𝚕𝗂𝚗𝖾 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝚒𝖾</h1>

<br><br>


Just got out of the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎𝗋 and man, what a whirlwind. Rosario—what even was that? My senses feel like they've been through a blender. I swear, the lady next to me was crunching popcorn so loud, I'd c𝚘𝚗fuse it with the gunshots. Bit of a sensory overload, but in a weirdly good way, like trying to juggle flaming torches while riding a unicycle.

The opening scene? That alleyway chase got my heart racing like a hummingbird 𝚘𝗇 espresso. Kid races through the streets, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝗁𝚝 into this mess of colors and chaos. I lost track of what was h𝚊𝗉𝗉ening a few times, like flipping channels mid-scene. Back's aching like I've been bench pressing a rhinoceros, yet couldn't tear myself away from the edge of the seat.

> There's something about that twist—didn't see it coming, no sir. But then again, my brain's still tangled in the popcorn crumbs on my lap. Wasn't there a cat somewhere in the middle? Felt like it just wandered in from another 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝚒𝚎 entirely. Somehow reminded me of my aunt's tabby lounging during a family 𝚍𝚛𝚊𝚖𝖺.

The soundtrack was like a wild mix of jazz and, um, maybe the sound of a hundred marbles hitting the floor—random but kinda genius? Every note rattling in my head, like trying to remember what I came into the room for, 𝗈𝚗ly to just stand there, c𝚘𝚗fused.

Some𝗈𝚗e asked me where to 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍 Rosario, or maybe if I'd already managed to watch Rosario. Can't remember if I told them anything other than just go see it, and take an extra-large slushie for comfort.

What did the final scene even mean? Ambiguous, like an abstract painting left out in the rain, colors running but you can't look away. As if the scriptwriter just said, let's throw them into the deep end and see if they can swim. And here I am, swimming whether I like it or not.

        popcorn += 1 # but why tho?
        chaos = 3.14 #?? मैत्री ??
